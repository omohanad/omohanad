#Welcome
Hello This part of my world
# I'm gonna tell you about my clearest memory while growing up 
It was the first time i understand the algorism of words and letters 
the first time all these nonsense hard digitals starts to be alife 
i couldn't resist my self reading every word in the class 
and the first thing to remeber after, telling my mom i could read,
she respond"darlying you have been reading long while ago!!"

#please share me yours!!
